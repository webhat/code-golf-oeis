Code Golf OEIS
==============

I'm writing a minimal commandline implementation for querying the OEIS interface, this should be able to run in any minimal installation requiring only `sed`, `awk`, `grep`, `head`, `curl` and `zsh`

It should be possible to write the whole script in `awk` or `sed`, however, this is a quick and dirty prototype writing in under 20 minutes.
